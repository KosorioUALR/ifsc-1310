    <h2>Thoughts of Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is an approach used in web development that prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity in designing user web experiences. The concept is centered on creating a basic functional website that can be accessed by all users, regardless of the device or browser they use to access it, and then enhancing the experience for users with more modern browsers and devices. Basically, it involves starting with a strong foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works for everyone, then adding more advanced features for the users with the more capable devices or browsers. Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it ensures that all users have equal access to web content, regardless of their device or browser. This approach promotes accessibility, which is especially important in a world where people access the internet using a wide range of devices. Additionally, by prioritizing accessibility and inclusivity, web developers can ensure that their websites are easily discoverable by search engines, which can help increase traffic and improve overall user experience. The article highlights the importance of progressive enhancement and provides practical tips for implementing it in web development. By embracing this approach, web developers can create websites that are accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly for any person that may access them.
